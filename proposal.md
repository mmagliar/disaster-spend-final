# US Federal Disaster Spending: A Look at the Numbers
By: David Kling, Michael Magliaro, and Benjamin Eck


#### What we are going to do:
Thus far in 2019 there have been 34 disasters declared by the Federal Government across the US.  In recent years records have been set for the number of federal disasters as well as the cost of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has paid out of the disaster relief fund for restitution and prevention.

Our project will be providing a overall country and state by state graphical analysis which depicts historical trending of disasters across the US as well as the funding FEMA has paid for public assistance, individual assistance and hazard mitigation.

#### Our Datasets:

[OpenFEMA Disaster Declarations Summaries](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-dataset-disaster-declarations-summaries-v1) - We will use this dataset to form link a between the other two datasets and to name and categorize each disaster event.
[FEMA Web Disaster Summaries](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-dataset-fema-web-disaster-summaries-v1) - From this dataset we will get the number of applicants for aid from different disasters.
[Table 4.1—Outlays by Agency: 1962–2024](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/) - We will use this data to compare the amount of money given to different departments of government.
